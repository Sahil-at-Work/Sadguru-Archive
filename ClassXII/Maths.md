# Vector Sections
This section introduces the section formula, a powerful tool for finding the position vector of a point that divides a line segment in a given ratio. We'll explore both internal and external division, as well as special cases like the midpoint and centroids

# Vector Products
This section explores how to "multiply" vectors. We'll learn about two distinct types of products: the scalar product (dot product), which yields a scalar quantity, and the vector product (cross product), which results in another vector. Understanding these products is fundamental to advanced vector operations

# The Cross
This post introduces the vector product, also known as the cross product, of two vectors. Unlike the scalar product, the cross product yields another vector. We'll explore its definition, properties, and its geometric significance in describing the orientation of a plane in 3D space.

# Vector Combinations
This section delves into the fascinating world of triple products involving three vectors. We'll explore both scalar and vector triple products, understanding their definitions, properties, and significant geometric interpretations in three-dimensional space.
